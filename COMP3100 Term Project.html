<h1>CS3100 Project A and B</h1>

<p>
The 3100 project requires the development of a web application
that stores <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet">spreadsheets</a>
for users, these spreadsheets can be
shared between users of the web site. 
The project will be done in two parts, A and B.
Part A will implement user account management for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication">authentication</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization">authorization</a>
and will provide mock-ups of the web pages for part B.
Authentication identifies a user, normally with a password.
Authorization determines what operations and access a particular user
has on the web applications. In part A, there should be normal users
and administrative users.
The mock-ups will describe the features to be implemented in part B.
</p>
<p>
   Some of the possible features of the web application include the following.
   The web application should allow for the creation of a
   spreadsheet with growable rows and columns.
   Data can be entered into the cells of the spreadsheet.
   The cells should be editable.
   The spreadsheet should be able to perform simple row and column
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet#Formulas">formulas</a>
   (e.g., sum, min, max, avg ...).
   The spreadsheet should be shareable to other users on the web site,
   or it should be private. The shared spreadsheets should be copyable.
   The web application should be able to draw simple
   plots of the data in the spreadsheet.
</p>
<p>
The general requirements for the project are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
A web application includes the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a>,
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a>,
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>,
media files, and any other files used by the browsers and server.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">nodejs</a>
and the <a href="https://expressjs.com/">express</a> framework must be used.
Any node packages can be used except ones that implement the core features
of a spreadsheet.
The project should use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a>
for building and testing. The <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/">Yarn</a>
package manager can be used instead of npm.
</li>
<li>
    CSS must be used to style the pages, the styling should be consistent
    across all pages.
</li>
<li>
    Communication with <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a>
    must be used for some of the pages (features).
</li>
<li>
    <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">Sqlite</a> must be used
    as the database engine for any database access.
    <b>No other database system is allowed.</b>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/">Web components</a>
    should be used for part of the application.
    The spreadsheet should be implemented with a web component.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">
Web sockets</a> can be used to implement client/server communication.
</li>
<li>
<b>Part A must provide the following</b>:
<ul>
<li>
user authentication (i.e., the system requires users to be registered and 
they must sign-in to have access to the system),
</li>
<li>
    attempting to access the web site without being logged in, should
    redirect the user to the login/registration page,
</li>
<li>
    a registration web page to allow a user to create an account,
</li>
<li>
    a web page to allow a user to change account details (e.g., change the
    account's password),
</li>
<li>
    a set of administrative web pages that can modify and delete
    user accounts (administrative web pages should only be accessible
    by an administrator, this means that there is a normal role and
    an administrative role),
</li>
<li>
    data for user accounts must be stored in a Sqlite database.
    The type of user account needs to be stored (e.g., user or admin).
</li>
<li>
    <del>
    mock up pages for the part B of the web application
    with a brief
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case">use case flow description</a>.
    </del>
    Example mock ups include a list of spreadsheets belong to a user,
    a sample spreadsheet, a list of spreadsheets that are shared.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>Part B must provide at least the following features/pages</b>:
<ul>
<li>a page the lists the shared spreadsheets,</li>
<li>the administrative user will have access to all the spreadsheets,</li>
<li>the shared spreadsheet should provide a button to copy a spreadsheet,</li>
<li>a page that lists the spreadsheets belong to the user
(both private and sharable),</li>
<li>each spreadsheet should have a name, and whether it is sharable,</li>
<li>the listing page should have a button/form to create a new spreadsheet,</li>
<li>the listing page should be able to edit the name,
delete the spreadsheet, and changes its sharing status,</li>
<li>
    a page to edit a spreadsheet, new rows and columns could
    be added, rows or columns could be deleted, cells could
    be editable,
</li>
<li>
    a spreadsheet should be exported using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> file,
</li>
<li>
    a spreadsheet should be imported using CSV file,
</li>
<b>The following two requiements have been deleted</b>
<del>
<li>
    any spreadsheet cell with a formula should be updated whenever
    the matching rows or columns change,
</li>
<li>
    the following formulas should be implemented:
    <ul>
        <li>abs(cell), absolute value for a cell</li>
        <li>sqrt(cell), square root for a cell</li>
        <li>pow(cell,constant), raise cell to a power of a constant</li>
        <li>max(any part row) or max(any part column)</li>
        <li>min(any part row) or min(any part column)</li>
        <li>avg(any part row) or avg(any part column)</li>
        <li>sum any part row or column with the same number of elements</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</del>
<li>
   any changes to a spreadsheet should be saved on the server, and
</li>
<li>
    at least three graphical reporting features (pie, line, bar graphs).
</li>
<li>
   to achieve full marks extra features, decided by the student,
   have to be added to the application
   (e.g., admistrative features, graphical reports, ...).
</li>
</ul>
